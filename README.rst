pandasReg
=========

pandasReg is an extension for `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ that adds some extra functionality for dealing with regularly-spaced time series data. It adds a new time series index `RPeriodIndex` that behaves very similarly to the built-in pandas index `PeriodIndex` but with some of the flexibility of pandas' `DatetimeIndex`.
